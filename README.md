# sentiment-analysis-bot

This bot uses the Discord API for command execution and Naive Bayes' classifiers to analyze the sentiments of messages sent in Discord. Utilizes the NLTK open source Python library for natural language processing and passes user inputs to a model trained from Twitter sample datasets.

Replace `'DISCORD_TOKEN'` with your Discord bot API key. It is recommended to create a separate `.env` file to store variables.

Execute with `python3 main.py`
